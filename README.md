## Core React

1.  ### What is React?

    React(aka React.js or ReactJS) is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** that is used for building composable user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach. 
    
    React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

2.  ### What are the major features of React?

    The major features of React are:

    - Uses **JSX** syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.
    - It uses **Virtual DOM** instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.
    - Supports **server-side rendering** which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).
    - Follows **Unidirectional or one-way** data flow or data binding.
    - Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.
